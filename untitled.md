### Title
Diversity at the Met

### Problem
Disparities in gender and race representation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art

### Background
Founded in 1870, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is now one of the most famous art galleries in the world. With works ranging 5,000 years according to their website, their collection captures much of recorded history through its artwork. Visitors come into the Met and experience history through the eyes of those who were present. However, we must question how much power the Met (and other galleries) have in showing history the way they want to show it.

While art invaluably captures perspectives from the past, we must ensure that museums reflect a range of perspectives, rather than the white, male perspective prevalent in art history. Much of art historical rhetoric today is about changing the canon. Many people's standard of "good art" is art created by white, European men. It is rare to discuss female or non-white artists working prior to the 19th century, and while European art is considered by time period, non-European art is often clumped together into one section, such as "African Art." We must consider how the field of art values the voices of those other than white males.

### Research Questions
1. Are women and men represented equally in the museum's collection?
2. Are non-white races and cultures represented proportionally in the collection to the world's rates? What about the US's rates?
3. Does more recent art (20th century and beyond) better reflect diversity than older art, since older art by minorities may not have been as well preserved or documented?

### Justification
Protests about museum diversity has been prevalent since the mid-20th century. A (work of art from 1989)[https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guerrilla-girls-do-women-have-to-be-naked-to-get-into-the-met-museum-p78793], created by a group called the Guerilla Girls, questions "Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?", citing that, at the time, less than 5% of the Modern art collection was female artists, while 85% of nude depictions in the museum were of women. This analysis will hopefully show some improvement from this figure. 

In terms of nationalities, universities are actively working to diversify the canon. In January 2020, Yale announced its plans to change its two art history survey course curriculum to classes that focused on art outside of Europe and America, which faced much backlash (Stiernberg). Similarly, UD is changing its Art History distribution requirements to four out of Pre-1400, 1400-1700, 1700-1900, 1900 to Modern, and "African, Asian, Islamic, Native American or Latin American art," theoretically allowing a student to dodge Eurocentric art entirely to a new system requiring both chronological and nationality distribution in August of this year. While it's great that universities are working to diversify art history, are museums with already-existing collections doing the same? Monica Gu explores in "Why don't we appreciate non-Western art?" the role that art history education has in appreciation of these works, and hopefully more diverse programs foster a higher appreciation, giving museums even more of a reason to host diverse collections (Gu).

Unfortunately, we must accept that the long history of art history has left us with many Eurocentric, male-created pieces of art. Since our culture did not value the voices of minorities, we are left with few pieces created by them and even less information on those pieces. Hopefully, by the 20th century, when women and cultural minorities were more recognized within the art world, the Met took the opportunity to diversify their collection. Works by women and minorities are more available to them than ever - if the numbers have not improved, there is no excuse for it.

### Dataset
(The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access CSV)[https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess]

### Dataset Explanation
This dataset was compiled by the Met itself, with each line representing a work in its collection. Along with information on each of the works, there is information about the artist, including their gender, culture, and nationality. Some data is left blank because it is unknown, which is an issue for many older pieces.

### Ethical Concerns
**Conclusions about the Met**: If I happen to find that genders are disproportionately represented in the museum, the Met is not automatically sexist. If cultures are disproportionately represented, the Met is not automatically catering to white suprematists. Unfortunately, art history has a long history of its own, and biases from history have long influenced what is considered valuable or worth keeping. Even if there were female artists during the Renaissance, history did not care enough about them to write about them or cherish their works the way we would cherish a Titian. If you are not an art history buff, you're likely looking forward to seeing a bunch of male artists' works because those male artists are what are most commonly taught as art history canon.

**De-valuing works of art**: Even if an artwork was created by a white male, it still has value and importance to the story of art. And because of the way art has long been a club of white men, many of the post important works in the world are arguably created by white men. This report is not meant to suggest that we should throw away current works of art until we have a 50-50 split between men and women and proportional nationalities; instead, it is just to point out the disparities that the canon has created.
